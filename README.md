# FPGA-Based-automatic-washing-machine

In this project we implement an automatic washing
machine on FPGA. To do the same we use Finite State Machine(FSM) based design and use Verilog HDL to design the state
machine. We are using Xilinx Zedboard as the FPGA. An FSM
design and Timer have been designed and has been succesfully
implemented on the FPGA.
